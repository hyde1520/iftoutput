Task refers to a specific operation within a stage of the IFTDSS Planning Cycle. For example, some tasks in the Landscape Evaluation stage include \u0027generating a landscape summary\u0027, and \u0027model fire behavior\u0027.',l:''},'timber':{d:'Trees; also, the wood from trees. Typically, a tree is a perennial woody plant with a single main trunk and and many secondary branches. A group of trees is called a stand, wood, timber, or forest, with number of trees determining which term is preferred.',l:''},'time lag':{d:'The length of time that a particle responds to within 63.2% of the new equilibrium moisture content (either drying or wetting). Larger diameter fuels generally have longer time-lags, meaning they respond more slowly to changes in environmental conditions.',l:''},'understory':{d:'The area of the forest in which plants are growing  at the lowest height level under the forest canopy. Typical plants include small trees, shrubs, herbs, vines, and small canopy trees that haven\u0027t yet made it to the top.',l:''},'unit':{d:'A unit encompasses a single or group of fuelbeds that are part of a fuel treatment (e.g., harvest unit, prescribed burn unit) or wildland fire.',l:''},'user-defined flame length':{d:'The flame length of a spreading surface fire within the flaming front is measured from midway in the active flaming combustion zone to the average tip of the flames. Flame length is an indicator of fire intensity. Flame lengths are divided into classes (low, medium, high, very high).',l:''},'WFDSS':{d:'Wildland Fire Decision Support System.
